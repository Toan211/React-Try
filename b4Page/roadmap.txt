this will summarize all contents of the lessons

3. tailwind

4. array of data (mapping) fetch from component and their unique key (uuid)

5. modals component, react bootstrap
modal = popup dialog
Need to install npm and add css dist to outermost js file (index.js) 
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'; (in index.js)

6.form 

7.update Employee
employee: pass from app.js to Employee.js to EditEmployee.js
provide the name and role to the modal field
then on Change the value (variable from app.js->employee.js)

For single page, avoid page refreshes, data must be update dynamically
to change state from parent, need pass down a callback function to execute when we want to change the state in the original component   

8.add new employee
Make new component named AddEmployee.js 
from app.js, make new function
set employee list, take an exist employee + an additional employee 
need clear up the state of add button (on form submit or button click) with setSth('')

9.  
pass component down as a property instead of function
meanning pass direct from app -> edit instead of app -> employee -> edit
define editEmployee inside app.js
 
 10.
tailwind navbar
need install npm @headlessui/react vs @heroicons/react

11. 
page
switch page and highlight the active page
extract employee file instead of put all thing in app.js
surround pages with a header (page elements)
make props of header, and render their child inside their tag

12.router
npm install neact-router-dom
need import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
    <BrowserRouter>
        <Routes>
            {/* structure of making a route: path = path and element = component */}
            <Route path="/employees" element={<Employees />} />
        </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>

then change the route of the header

13. active page
NavLink have the active capability built into it 
from "react-router-dom"
NavLink use "to" to contain url 
if the error of useLocation showup, meaning u are not within BrowserRouter (meaning header should also be inside that)
if still error from BrowserRouter , use <> </>

14. clean code vs fixing stuff from header
class App should belong to app.js, meanwhile other belong to header.js,
    so they can have all the style in the same way, after header

15. use eff hook
fetch data from api 
Use effect: allow some section of code will execute anytimes states change
                and it will run after the page initually loaded
            something that happen when do something else, side effect
    Mutation, subscription, timers, logging, and other side eff are not allow inside the function of component
        cus of bug and stuff, so we can put these inside unse eff
    Use effect execute once per page load & once per each change in state
    UseEffect is a function 
    It will update the state as it executes after the state is update 

We want it to be defined within our functional component (meaning inside the {} of a function)

16: useEffect with dependency array
This is second function we can pass as a argument
    Restrict what state we care about for useEffect to be trigger

        no dependency array => update for any state change, and it will stack (not what we want)
            for example: it will update whenever word1 or word2 update
        empty dependency array [] => execute once        
            for example: it will update only when page load    
        value dependency array [word] => execute once        
            for example: it will update only when word1 state is update, but WONT update when word2 state is update   
                            and we can trust word1 is up to date, but word2 maybe outdate (useEffect will depend on word1 only)

useEffect can have multiple times with different dependency
There is also a thing call useEffect cleanup

17: fetch data from API
make Definition key
often time for an API u need a key to identity your access to use that API
that require a key which make your application insecure, you dont want that key out =>ppl use your key => u lose money
    => use API key on the backend application ., connect to the backend
        => for learning, use api no key

Using fetch to make request to that api

18: URL and param
